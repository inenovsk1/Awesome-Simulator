Changed parsing of csv files to use strtok_r instead of strtok.
strtok_r is thread safe and therefore better than strtok!

Finished documenting the existing code base.
Added Utilities namespace that contains and implements stand alone
functions used throughout the simulator.

Implement parsing tickers whose data does not exist / starts later than
simulator start date.

Added support for using IBM as a reference ticker to find the earliest date
for which there is stock market historical data.
Started working on adding missing values to tickers whose historical data
doesn't go all the way back to the first date in the universe.

Completed code for using IBM as reference ticker and adding missing price
data to newer tickers. The value used to specify unavailable data is -999
and is defined as a constant in the TickerData class!
