----------------------------- Week 1 -------------------------------------
2/8/2018
Started documenting the exisitng code base.

2/11/2018
Changed parsing of csv files to use strtok_r instead of strtok.
strtok_r is thread safe and therefore better than strtok!
Finished documenting the existing code base.
Added Utilities namespace that contains and implements stand alone
functions used throughout the simulator.
Implement parsing tickers whose data does not exist / starts later than
simulator start date.

2/13/2018
Added support for using IBM as a reference ticker to find the earliest date
for which there is stock market historical data.
Started working on adding missing values to tickers whose historical data
doesn't go all the way back to the first date in the universe.

2/14/2018
Completed code for using IBM as reference ticker and adding missing price
data to newer tickers. The value used to specify unavailable data is -999
and is defined as a constant in the TickerData class!
Refactored many variables for better clarity.

----------------------------- Week 2 -------------------------------------
2/18/2018
Created and started working on the Simulator class.
Created and started working on the MessageLog class.

----------------------------- Week 3 -------------------------------------
2/25/2018
StockStream - This class is like a stream it will feed price data into it
for each date. The idea is that when running the simulator one can use either the
in memory databse, or data from some server, etc.. Might implement this for
data access.

2/27/2018
DateTime class - created incrementDate function that increments the date to the next
date and overloaded the ++ operator, which increments only week days, however,
it skips weekend days since there is no stock data during the weekends,
we do not really care about weekend days.
Fixed Configurations class constructor to use an rvalue reference for
efficiency reasons - i.e. so that it does not copy the whole data structure
previously parsed by ConfigParser, but simply point to it instead!
Decided to use uniqie_ptrs for class Simulator's member variables so that
they can be initialized later on in the derived classes - i.e LongShort, etc..
Created class LongShort and started working on implementation of the class.
question - What is an appropriate signal value for a model?!?!?!
