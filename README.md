# Awesome-Simulator
A personal financial simulator project for learning purposes (and fun!). Not to be used for real world trading! If you do, don't blame it on me, when losing money :)
Please, also note that this is far (by a long shot) from doing tasks the way a commercial simulator would, but was rather an experiment that allowed me to test different implementation ideas while building it.
